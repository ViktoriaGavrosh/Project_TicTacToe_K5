# Project_TicTacToe_K5
This project created during the learning process

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players on a 
3x3 grid. One of the players is 'X', and 
the other player is 'O'. X plays first, 
then O takes the next turn, and so on.
The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.
The first player that puts 3 X's or 3 O's in 
a straight line (including diagonals) wins 
the game.

- The program prints an empty grid at the 
beginning of the game.
- Users take turns entering the coordinates 
of the cell ("2 3"), the program analyzes 
the move for correctness and shows the grid 
with changes if everything is in order. 
The first player has to play as X and their 
opponent plays as O.
- Ends the game when someone wins or there 
is a draw. 

Grid for players has coordinates 1, 2, 3
